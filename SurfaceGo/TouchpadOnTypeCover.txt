To enable trackpad, first figure out what product you have. (the Type cover comes with 3 different ID's)

to do this, open a terminal and type dmesg after connecting the type cover.
Then look for the following output:

usb 1-3: Product: Surface Type Cover
usb 1-3: Manufacturer: Microsoft
usb-1.3: New USB device found idVendor=045e, idProduct=07dc

Once you have your productId, open /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf in your favourite editor and insert the following code:

Code:
Section "InputClass" 
Identifier "Surface Pro 3 cover"
MatchIsPointer "on"
MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
Driver "evdev"
Option "vendor" "045e"
Option "product" "07dc"  <--replace with your ID
Option "IgnoreAbsoluteAxes" "True"
EndSection
reboot and you're good to go
